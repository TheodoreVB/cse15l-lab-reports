# Lab Report 5

## EDSTEM POST:

### Student:

So, I tried getting the code for the autograde for Lab 6 working, but I'm running into issues with the compile error check. It is properly functioning when the student's code is correct (Screenshot 1) as well as when the student's code has a compile error (Screenshot 2), however, I am running into an issue when the student's code contains errors but not a compile error (Screenshot 3).
